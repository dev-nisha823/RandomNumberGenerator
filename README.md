# RandomNumberGenerator
* The randomness of generating a random number  is essential for creating unpredictable and dynamic outcomes, contributing to the robustness and versatility of numerous algorithms and applications.
* Random module is having a lot of functions like randint(), randuniform(), etc,.
* But in this project I have taken the user input in the form of range and then giving the output as a random numbers it can be positive or negative depends on the user input.
* If user will enter one positive and one negative number in the same datatype then he/she will get error that you have not given a correct range. User can enter one of number as +ve integer and other +ve floating number.
* User can enter one of number as - ve integer and other -ve floating number. User can enter both the number +ve , -ve.
